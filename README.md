# DnDCombatHelper
A CLI for helping with combat in DnD

--Currently implemented:

Character list with NPCs and Players that each have their own initiative.

NPCs have base stats starting at 10 (hope to implement a SQL database that contains all the npcs and import these).

Addition of more enemies under a specific enemy type (ex addmore zombie 4 adds 4 more to the zombie npc.

startcom will start combat and sort by initiative, iterate through combat with n.

in the startcom section, addhp and subhp can be used on NPCs (ex subhp 1 12) will remove 12 hp from the key 1 npc of that type.
