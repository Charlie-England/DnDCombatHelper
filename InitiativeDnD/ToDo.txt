To Implement:

Larger Goal: Add SQL Library of DnD Monsters so that you can add specific monsters
	-once this is done, allow attacks to be made by all monsters alive

allow use to set key values for monsters?
CharList should be a dictionary with <String Names, Character> this will allow for easier checking of key value errors / duplicate keys

Completed:
-once an npc reaches 0 hp, mark it as dead?
